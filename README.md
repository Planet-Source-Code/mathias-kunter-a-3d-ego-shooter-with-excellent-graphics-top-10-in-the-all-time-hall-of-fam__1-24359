### Description

Hot!!! A completly 3d ego-shooter with excellent graphics, named Shot It! This is version 1.4 with sounds! You can move with the keyboard and look around with the mouse, like in Quake 3 Arena. You can collect a MG and fire with the left mouse button. You can't walk through trees and walls. A bot is also walking through the landscape. Try to frag it as often as possible to get very much points. A highscore is also included. The game is programmed with DirectX 7. CHECK OUT THE SCREENSHOT NOW!

Known bug: If you play this game in combination with Win2000 and DirectX 8, the textures are looking very strange. So, play the game in another PC configuration!
